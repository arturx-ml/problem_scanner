1. Is there a solution to polymarkets 'no contest' situation?

Recently polymarket had a market on a UFC fight between Aspinal and Gane, which resulted in no contest. As per their settlement rules, everyone who traded on that market received a 50-50 split for their bet per share, which sparked a lot of outrage.

Im curious to know is there a solution to this issue besides 50-50? How else would you be able to solve this issue since all the money has already been transacted and theres no way to refund users directly for the money they already have placed into the market?
